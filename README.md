The coding of the mouseover part was pretty simple. But I do notice that sometimes it's not super seamless. I wasn't able to figure out the mousout portion. It was giving me errors (I commented this code out so you can see). I also couldn't figure out how to get hover over the submenu list options, and tried a few different things.
